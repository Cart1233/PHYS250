Section 3.1 Simple Harmonic Motion
	Force perpendicular to a pendulum is $$f_0=-m*g*sin(Theta)$$
	Newtons second law: force is equal to m*a
	Displacement along the arc is s=l*theta
	use arrays to calc omega, theta, and t.
	the motion is oscillatory, with the amplitude growing with time.
	energy remains constant
	smaller time step makes errors smaller
	v= omega*l
	Energy with the Euler method is always positive
Section 3.2 Making the Pendulum more Interesting
	we add friction here, which is always negative as it works against the pendulum
	q measures the strength of dampening
	dampening is things like friction and air resistance
	theres three regimes of dampening, the first is under-damped, followed by over-damped, then finally criticaly damped
	each dampness has its own equation
	we add an external driving force
Section 3.3 Chaos in the Driven Nonlinear Pendulum 
	add all three prior discussed methods become combined in equation 3.18
	this equation is for nonlinear, damped, driven pendulum, called the physical pendulum
	theta is awlays between -pi and pi
	pendulum can now spin all the way around its pivot point
	the motion of the pendulum is an interplay of the natural frequency and the frequency of the driving force
	at low drive the motion is a simple oscillation
	at high drive the motion is chaotic
	dips in delta theta occur when one pendulum reaches a turning point
	when pendulums start with nearly the same initial conditions their trajectories will diverge exponentially fast
	a system can obey certain laws of physics, but can exhibit unpredictable behavior due to sensitivity to initial conditions
	phase-space plot is angular velocity as a function of theta
	things look simpiler when observed at a rate that matches the problem
